# Steps in K-Nearest Neighbour

-> Importing the libraries

-> Importing the dataset

-> Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set

-> Training the K-NN model on the Training set

-> Predicting a new result

-> Predicting the Test set results

-> Making the Confusion Matrix

-> Visualising the Training set results

-> Visualising the Test set results
